# Front-end Web Development Project Idea

By: Anastassiya Ryabkova and Ozioma Okonicha



### Project Summary

Our amazing project called **TindArt** is going to be like Tinder but for art. It is going to be a platform for artlovers to find each other and paint/ draw/ discuss/ criticize happily ever after!

<u>Note</u>: *We will not be implementing our own backend and hence we will make use of the public API* [Art Institute of Chicago](https://api.artic.edu/docs/#collections)
